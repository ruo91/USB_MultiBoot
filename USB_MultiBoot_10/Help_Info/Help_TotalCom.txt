   ***** Use Total Commander For Update of Existing USB-Drive *****

   Total Commander Synchronize Dirs in Asymmetric mode Results in an Update of the Right Directory

   Use Total Commander For Update of Existing USB-Drive having XP LocalSource Folders:

1. Before the FileCopy of XP Source to USB-Drive starts, it is possible to Leave the USB_MultiBoot.cmd Program

2. Plugin Your USB-Drive having XP LocalSource Folders

3. Start Total Commander
   Select as Left  Directory Your XP BootFolder as Source Folder:  USB_MultiBoot\usb_xpbt\$WIN_NT$.~BT
   Select as Right Directory Your USB-Drive   with Target Folder:  $WIN_NT$.~BT

4. Nothing ....

5. Select Commands / Synchronize Dirs ...
   Select Asymmetric and Subdirs On
   Select Show - Green and Blue On
   Select Show - duplicates and singles On ( Default )

6. Select Compare to Start the comparison between the two chosen directories

   The symbol in the middle defines the copy direction, which can be chosen by the end user. 
   The coloring of the text defines the default copy direction determined by the comparison:
   Green: Copy from left to right
   Blue:  Delete on the right side (Asymmetric mode, the file has a Red cross symbol X in the middle)

   Never Make a Blue Arrow because that has a Copy direction from Target to Source (Unwanted)
   
   The symbol in the middle is not Selected when the Source File is Older then the Target File.
   In general Update of such files must be Accepted giving them the Green Arrow,
   because our Source is always considered better than the USB-Drive Target.
   An Exception is migrate.inf ( and boot.ini in Root Dir ) which must NOT be replaced on USB-Drive.

   The Bootsector Files SETUPLDR.bs and BackupBS.ori in the btsec folder of the Right Directory 
   would get in Comparison a Red Cross, but these files must not be Deleted from the USB-Drive.
   So for these 2 files the Red Cross must be removed by mouseclick.

7. Select Synchronize to Automatically
   Copy    the Green selected files from Left to Right Dir ( Use No Confirm Overwrites )
   Deletes the Blue  selected files on the Right Directory ( marked with Red Cross in the middle )

8. Repeat Steps 4-7 for the $WIN_NT$.~LS Folder and the OEM Folder if present in usb_xpbt

9. Select as Left  Directory Your USB_MultiBoot\usb_xpbt Folder
   Select as Right Directory Your USB-Drive Root Directory as Target

10. Copy txtsetup.sif from the Left Source Dir to the USB-Drive Target Directory on the Right side

11. Select as Left  Directory Your XP Source Folder
    Select as Right Directory Your USB-Drive   with Target Folder:  $WIN_NT$.~LS
    Repeat Steps 5-7 To Update XP LocalSource Folder on your USB-Drive

Instead of the Copy of about 6000 files in 15 minutes to USB-Drive,
one needs to copy may be only 150 files in the Asymmetric Synchronize Update.

***** GOOD LUCK *****
