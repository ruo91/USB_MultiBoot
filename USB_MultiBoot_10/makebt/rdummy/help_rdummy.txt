Here is what has to be added to usb_prep.cmd to add rdummy driver. 


CODE
ECHO Adding lines to TXTSETUP.SIF ....
.............
REM added for USB hard drives, loads rdummy.sys during Text Setup, which makes usbstor to see USB drives as removable
fedit -f %tmpdrive%\txtsetup.sif -add -once -l "rdummy.sys = 1,,,,,,4_,4,1,,,1,4" -s SourceDisksFiles
fedit -f %tmpdrive%\txtsetup.sif -add -once -l "rdummy = rdummy.sys,4" -s SCSI.Load
fedit -f %tmpdrive%\txtsetup.sif -add -once -l "rdummy = \"USB hard disk as removable\"" -s SCSI
fedit -f %tmpdrive%\$WIN_NT$.~BT\winnt.sif -add -create -l "\"sc config rdummy start= disabled"" -s GuiRunOnce
copy rdummy.sy_ %tmpdrive%\$WIN_NT$.~LS\I386
copy rdummy.sy_ %tmpdrive%\$WIN_NT$.~BT


rdummy.sy_ and it's source code are in the attachment. 
Installation tested with XP SP2 source, 80GB IDE HD, generic IDE-USB adapter. 
Drive formated FAT16x with 1.9GB partition using PEtoUSB. 
XP built-in format didn't make it bootable. 
On first GUI logon rdummy service is disabled, on next reboot it'll be inactive. 
If one needs to reenable it simply change startup type in services to 0, 
or use "sc config rdummy start= boot".

WARNING!!! There is no warranty whatsoever for this driver and it's behavior, 
use it COMPLETELY at your own risk. 
The only issue I've seen by now is BSOD 7B when F3 is pressed to quit from Setup, 
but there may be others. Not tested with 2K/2K3.
