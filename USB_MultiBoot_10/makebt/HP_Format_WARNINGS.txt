***** WARNINGS *****
Be very carefull with writing of bootsectors with HDHacker, bootsect.exe or mkbt.exe
Be always aware you make your changes on the right drive. Otherwise loss of DATA may be the result.
It is advisable to first remove all other removable drives, like USB Backup Harddisks and Memory Cards,
so that they cannot be involved by mistake in the writing process.

HP USB Disk Storage Format Tool Destroys Partition Table of USB-Harddisk and
cannot be used to Format one single partition of USB-Harddisk. 
Using HP Tool makes Data partitions of USB-Harddisk inaccessible !!
So don't use HP USB Disk Storage Format Tool to Format USB-Harddisk.

Using PeToUSB.exe is SAFE, it can only Format partitions with size less than 2 GB
without destroying the existing partition table, so that Data partitions are still accessible.

Use of USB_MultiBoot.cmd and everything in this Guide is COMPLETELY at your own risk.
